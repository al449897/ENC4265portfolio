# Chatbot

I created a ChatBot with [Chatling.AI](https://chatling.ai/) to assist prospectives students in filling out the [UCF SPARK form](https://www.ucf.edu/admissions/undergraduate/spark/), a document that is required for incoming students that are still in high school. 

This process can be tedious and confusing, and the video instructions are still not the most viable option given that there are many unique variables that can go into determining how to fill out the form. The site would benefit from having an interactive chat that can answer questions quickly.

I made sure to follow UCF's general style of having a friendly, light-hearted, yet professional tone in their communications to students within this bot by making a specific query to do so in order to make the experience slightly more enjoyable. 

SPARKBot pulls it's information from the [SPARK Form instructions site](https://www.ucf.edu/admissions/undergraduate/spark/) as well as the [SPARK form FAQ site](https://www.ucf.edu/admissions/undergraduate/faq/spark-form/). 

The SPARKBot can be found [here](https://share.chatling.ai/s/MiP7Xknuof8DUR6).
