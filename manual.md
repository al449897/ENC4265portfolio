## What *are* Mods?

Mods are downloadable alterations, or modifications, to the original Sims 4 game to introduce gameplay features that aren’t present within the base game or any of the purchasable content packs. These installments can range from clothing to colorful loading screens. 

Whether you want more diversity in your game through the installation of hairstyles, skin tones, or cultural wear, or if you desire to have more intense realism gameplay with terminal illnesses, serial killers, or even natural disasters, there are thousands of mods available for download across the internet to cater to your preferred gaming experience. 

### Types of Mods
There are two different types of mods for The Sims 4: script and custom content. 

**Script mods** are specifically altering the coding script within the game, meaning that specific features will be removed, added, or altered in order to change how the game operates. For instance, one mod alters the speed at which Sims in University complete their homework; another allows for the customization of pregnancy length. 

**Custom Content mods** entail furniture or the alteration of Sim’s appearance through hair, clothes, makeup, nails, and more within Create-A-Sim. There are two variations of custom content: alpha and Maxis Match. 

- <ins>Maxis Match</ins> custom content are Create-A-Sim items that match Maxis’ (the developers of Sims) custom script. This means that the items that modders create will look as if the Sims team created it themselves, and matches in with the animation style of the game. 

- <ins>Alpha</ins>  custom content are Create-A-Sim items that do not match Maxis’ custom script, meaning that they do not fit in the Sim’s animation style of the game. This is optimal for those who want a hyper-realistic or hyper-cartoonish appearance for their Sims.

## How to Find and Research Mods 

Mods can be found on various websites such as Tumblr, Patreon, ModtheSims, and modder’s personal websites. YouTube is also a great place to start to get a compilation of other player’s favorite mods as a jumpstart. With any website, make sure that it is safe and trustworthy; if you are unsure, try researching the mod or modder and read reviews before clicking anything. 

Before you download a mod, there are a few crucial steps you need to take to ensure that your game and computer remain safe from harm. 

### Checking Mod Requirements 
1. **Make sure that the mod is up to date and safe.** Game updates usually break most mods as the coding script changes, so it’s important to check for updates routinely. Broken mods can cause issues or glitches in your game. 

Usually, there is a compilation of mods that are safe or broken after new updates. You can either:
- Find a list that people create, such as through EA forums or Scarlet’s Realm. 
- Check the social media or websites of the creator of the mod to see their personal updates on their mods. 

2. **Read the requirements before downloading.** Some mods require you to have specific packs or other mods downloaded prior to theirs being installed. Additionally, one specific mod may conflict with other mods you may have already.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These requirements are crucial to read beforehand as improper or broken mods can harm your game or even your computer. 

## Installation 

Before downloading and installing your mods, you need to differentiate between the file types that they will download as: **.package, .ts4script, or .zip.**
- A **.package or .ts4script** file is a singular file that can easily be dragged into the mods folder without alteration. 

- A **.zip** file is a folder with multiple files located within it for a more simplistic way of downloading many items at once. 

Both files have the same exact download methods, but differ in the transferring process. 

### Installing a .package or .ts4script File 
I created a quick, four minute tutorial on how to install these files.

If you prefer written instructions, though, here is how you go about it:

1. **Opening the “Files" folder**.  It’s finally time to download! For the smoothest process, it’s best to open up your Mods folder prior to downloading in order to make the transfer quicker:

- Go to the “Files” folder on your desktop 
- Click on “Documents” 
- Click on “Electronic Arts”
- Click on “Sims 4”
- Click on “Mods”

2. **Downloading Mod From the Internet.**  On the webpage where your script mod is open, click on either the “Download” button or hyperlink. 

- There may be multiple options to click from, such as downloading from various websites. Choose whichever one you feel comfortable navigating. 
  - If you get taken to another website that has the mod, click the download button again. 

- You should now see the popup at the bottom of your screen that has the .package file. 

3. **Locate the File.** The easiest way to locate your file is by clicking the right arrow next to the file popup along the bottom of your screen and clicking “Locate File”. It will open another File window and display the mod right there.

4. **Moving the File.** Once you see where the file was placed, you will simply hold down and drag the file over to the left side of the screen where the Mods folder is already open in order to transfer it over. 

Make sure that the mod is properly located in the “Mods” folder. Once it is, it has been properly downloaded. 

> [!WARNING]
>  Make sure the file is directly in the “Mods” folder OR it is located in a SINGULAR folder within the “Mods” folder in order for the game to render that it is installed. If it is buried too deep, it can’t be read.

## Installing a .zip File 

1. **Opening the “Files" folder**.  It’s finally time to download! For the smoothest process, it’s best to open up your Mods folder prior to downloading in order to make the transfer quicker:

4. **Moving the File.** Once you see where the file was placed, you will:
- Right click and click “Extract All”
- Make sure the file path is located to the “Mods” folder 
- Click “Browse”
- Click “Documents”, then “Electronic Arts”, “Sims 4”, and then the “Mods” folder. 
- Delete the .zip file as it is now empty.

> [!WARNING]
>  Make sure the file is directly in the “Mods” folder OR it is located in a SINGULAR folder within the “Mods” folder in order for the game to render that it is installed. If it is buried too deep, it can’t be read.

## Ensuring Proper Installation 

In order to make sure that the mods show up in the game, you need to have mods and CC enabled in settings: 

1. Open The Sims 4 
2. In the home screen, navigate to the three buttons at the top right corner 
3. Select “Options” 
4. Click the checkbox next to “Enable mods and custom content” as well as “Allow script mods” 
5. Restart the game to allow for these settings to enact. 
6. After restarting, every single one of your mods should appear in a large, scrollable list. Here you can view which mods are properly in your game and whether or not they were installed properly. 

Now you can go into your game and enjoy your new mods properly! 

## What to Do After a Sims Update

Script mods break after updates due to the developers changing the actual code within the game which almost all mods rely on. Given this, without that foundational structure, most mods cannot function and end up incompatible with the most current game mode. 

In the best cases, it will simply be unusable in the game. In the worst cases, it can cause glitches, corrupted save files, a completely broken game, or even cause damage to your computer. 

The best case of action to do before and after an update is to, 

1. Drag the “Mods” folder to your desktop to remove it from the game entirely. 
2. Update your game. 
3. Go through each of your script mods and check either the compilation lists or the modders page to ensure that it didn’t break. 
5. If it is broken, delete the mod and download the updated version if available. 
6. If it is still compatible, you can keep it in your mods folder.
