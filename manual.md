## What *are* Mods?

Mods are downloadable alterations, or modifications, to the original Sims 4 game to introduce gameplay features that aren’t present within the base game or any of the purchasable content packs. These installments can range from clothing to colorful loading screens. 

Whether you want more diversity in your game through the installation of hairstyles, skin tones, or cultural wear, or if you desire to have more intense realism gameplay with terminal illnesses, serial killers, or even natural disasters, there are thousands of mods available for download across the internet to cater to your preferred gaming experience. 

### Types of Mods
There are two different types of mods for The Sims 4: script and custom content. 

**Script mods** are specifically altering the coding script within the game, meaning that specific features will be removed, added, or altered in order to change how the game operates. For instance, one mod alters the speed at which Sims in University complete their homework; another allows for the customization of pregnancy length. 

**Custom Content mods** entail furniture or the alteration of Sim’s appearance through hair, clothes, makeup, nails, and more within Create-A-Sim. There are two variations of custom content: alpha and Maxis Match. 

- <ins>Maxis Match</ins> custom content are Create-A-Sim items that match Maxis’ (the developers of Sims) custom script. This means that the items that modders create will look as if the Sims team created it themselves, and matches in with the animation style of the game. 

- <ins>Alpha</ins>  custom content are Create-A-Sim items that do not match Maxis’ custom script, meaning that they do not fit in the Sim’s animation style of the game. This is optimal for those who want a hyper-realistic or hyper-cartoonish appearance for their Sims.

## How to Find and Research Mods 

Mods can be found on various websites such as Tumblr, Patreon, ModtheSims, and modder’s personal websites. YouTube is also a great place to start to get a compilation of other player’s favorite mods as a jumpstart. With any website, make sure that it is safe and trustworthy; if you are unsure, try researching the mod or modder and read reviews before clicking anything. 

Before you download a mod, there are a few crucial steps you need to take to ensure that your game and computer remain safe from harm. 

### Checking Mod Requirements 
1. **Make sure that the mod is up to date and safe.** Game updates usually break most mods as the coding script changes, so it’s important to check for updates routinely. Broken mods can cause issues or glitches in your game. 

Usually, there is a compilation of mods that are safe or broken after new updates. You can either:
- Find a list that people create, such as through EA forums or Scarlet’s Realm. 
- Check the social media or websites of the creator of the mod to see their personal updates on their mods.
