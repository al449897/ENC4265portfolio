# Welcome to my Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 
Hello! My name is Alexis and I am an English Technical Communication major with a certificate in Editing and Publishing. I aim to become a technical writer, specifically with grant proposals or instruction manuals, or even as a copy editor for scholarly journals. I am also passionate about writing research-based essays, especially about women, race, and queerness and how it intersects with communities, media, and other facets of human life. I have academic experience creating onboarding manuals, a university style guide, and copyediting dozens of pieces. My prior jobs have allowed me to enhance my interpersonal, collaboration, and decision-making skills that have all tailored into my skillset as an editor and writer.
