# Wayback Analysis
Amazon is a powerhouse website that sells hundreds of thousands of items from furniture to dental care. To accommodate for the amount of consumers they receive daily, their current website reflects a simplistic and easy user experience that allows for items to be searched or found within seconds. Unfortunately, their website has not always had the best design for its products. In this blog, I'll be briefly analyzing Amazon's home page from their 2000 website and comparing it to their current 2025 one. 
## The Problem

Immediately when navigating this April 2000 archived site, I was overwhelmed by the amount of text and hyperlinks. The inclusion of the left sidebar named “Browse” seems redundant considering the top menu that includes the same categories; it’s a waste of space and confusing for users. These horizontal sidebars are what threw me off the most, as there were so many options to choose from and very minimal design elements to aid in those choices.

 I also rarely see sidebars like these anymore either, as menus are usually horizontally laid out on the top of a webpage so users can read it more naturally from left to right as opposed from top to bottom. It was difficult to take in everything on the page, and it took me entirely too long to read through all of the options that I was presented with. I felt like I was reading pages worth of content as I am so used to seeing all of my options laid out in front of me within seconds, and then further diving into subcategories through that. If this was Amazon’s website in 2025, it would not be as popular of a platform as it is today.

## Modern Websites and Their Solutions  
Websites today tend to have less open white space, bigger text, more color, distinct headings, and a more “cleaned-up” look that has minimal distractions, huge text or photos, or misplaced links and headings. Amazon’s current home page layout is vastly different from their 2000 one, as they have a shortened menu at the top underneath the search bar so that users can quickly look up or navigate to the item they are looking for. The deals and promoted items are right underneath this to inform users of what they might be interested in, but it is set up in a way that fills up space and is easy to look at thanks to the photos and organization that is presented. This is an amazing home page in my opinion, as I can get to what I need within seconds and not be overwhelmed by unnecessary information when I decide to shop.

Overall, modern website design is heavily catered to have the easiest user experience in order for them to complete their purchase or task quickly. Amazon’s previous websites have been constantly revamped, as they lacked coherence, simplicity, and design, to become what it is today.

# Voyant Analysis
![voyant page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3d81553-6e44-497d-b096-457744233f17)
*Figure 1: Voyant analysis page*

Using [Voyant.com](https://voyant-tools.org/), a website tailored to aid in dissecting digital texts to reveal patterns and other information. In a given file or link, users can discover recurring words, collocates (words that frequently appear next to each other), document summaries, connections between specific terms, and more. With this use of Voyant, I chose to analyze a 130-page 2012 [HP Elitebook manual](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/626334/Hp-Laptop.html#manual) in order to determine the most repeated words as I had never analyzed a technical document in this manner. 

![voyant ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cb108bb-13be-47b8-95ed-fb5412153da0)

*Figure 2: Voyant's visual compilation of the most used words in the HP manual* 

My results were interesting. In descending order, with the amount of times referenced in the manual being in parentheses, the most used words were

1. Computer (182)
2. Page (139)
3. Using (116)
4. Select (94) 
5. HP (92)
6. Drive (84)
7. Hard (62)
8. Models (57)
9. Power (56)
10. Screen (53)

Obviously, “computer” was the most used term as the manual has to refer to the product it's written about in order to give directions on how to operate it. I was surprised by the lack of action words in the top 10 as “select” was the one that was used the most, while nouns and verbs dominated the rest of the list. Dan Jones in “Technical Writing Style” notes how it’s imperative to include “action in your verbs” in order to incorporate “more energy or power into your writing” and make it “more direct and forceful” (92).  Given this, as well as the overall emphasis on making technical writing to-the-point, minimal, yet efficient, I was expecting to see more commands and verbs in this short list. Yet, it makes sense how aspects of the computer would be referenced more. 

This software has allowed me to have a birds-eye view of a large document without skimming every page for myself while also laying out detailed information on connections within the text and the language used. Voyant can be useful for research papers or projects, especially those that contain comparing documents between different subjects or sources and finding the trends between them. It’s a critical tool that can be beneficial for many, but especially for literary analysts and those in the humanities who want to connect text on a deeper scale.

# BoodleBox Claude AI Resume Review 

***Assignment Prompt Q: Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field.*** 


I used BoodleBox’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI to assess and revise my current resume.  

![Screenshot 2025-02-20 193026](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85cb9891-71d9-4106-a670-bd4d5191c4e5)

*Figure 1: Screenshot of my current editing resume*


## Initial Assessment 
I uploaded the resume above and asked Claude 3.5 the following prompt:


> *“Using the information from this resume, what career position do you believe I am best suited for?”*

It responded with the following answer. I formatted it with bolded text to make it easier to read:

“Based on your educational background and experience shown in your resume, you appear to be well-suited for several career positions in the technical communication and editing field. Here are my top recommendations:


**1. Technical Editor/Copy Editor**
   
   - Your coursework in Professional Editing and experience with Track Changes, APA, and MLA styles make you an excellent candidate
     
   - Your demonstrated ability to handle large editing projects (700+ edits in one semester, 20-page journal submissions)
     
   - Strong attention to detail and commitment to maintaining professional standards


**2. Documentation Specialist**
   
   - Your experience in developing comprehensive style manuals
     
   - Background in Documentation and Project Management
     
   - Technical Communication degree focus


**3. Content Manager/Editor**
   
   - Experience in collaborative environments
     
   - Skills in maintaining consistency in written communication
     
   - Strong background in comprehensive editing and style guide implementation


**4. Publishing Assistant/Editorial Assistant**
   
   - Your Certificate in Editing and Publishing
     
   - Experience with various style guides
     
   - Strong academic performance (3.7 GPA, Dean's List)


Your membership in Sigma Tau Delta (English Honor Society) and strong academic performance demonstrate your commitment to excellence in the field. Your customer service experience as a Leasing Agent also adds valuable interpersonal and administrative skills that would be beneficial in any of these roles.


Given your educational focus and practical experience, I believe you would be most successful starting in an editorial role that allows you to utilize both your technical communication skills and your detailed editing abilities.”

These responses are what I was expecting to see, especially given the fact that this is the resume that I use when applying for editing or technical roles. It was great to get confirmation that this resume is applicable for the roles that I apply for. 

## Revision 

I then asked Claude to revise my resume:


> *“Thank you. Please revise and tailor my resume so that it would be appealing to a future hiring manager within the copyediting field”.*


It provided with me with the following answer. Again, I formatted it with bolded text to make it easier to read:


"I'll help you revise your resume to better highlight your relevant experience and skills for a copyediting position. Here's a tailored version:

## My Experience 
I then asked Claude, 


> *“Please make the revised resume into a properly formatted, downloadable pdf”.*


It, unfortunately, was not able to do so, but provided many options and resources for how to format the text myself in a word document processing software. 


Beyond this qualm of not being able to create documents within the system, I enjoyed using this AI. I have never used another tool besides ChatGPT, so it was a new experience to use another platform and watch it operate. I genuinely enjoyed the feedback it gave me for my resume and I will absolutely be integrating it within my current one to update it. I enjoyed how it listened to my requests and gave reasoning for why it answered the way that it did; I don’t see that too often when I use ChatGPT as it simply listens to and completes my request, but Claude explained everything along the way and even provided alternative options if it wasn’t able to aid in me in some manner. 


Overall, BoodleBox as a site was also easy to use and provided a lot of options for AI tools that I would be able to use.I wouldn’t be opposed to using Claude again for AI testing as it provided great feedback and detailed analyses on its choices. I’m excited about navigating the other tools through this class and having the chance to choose which one best tailors to my academic and career needs.

# ChatBot Reflection

For my latest assignment in this course, I interacted with [Chatling.ai](https://share.chatling.ai/s/MiP7Xknuof8DUR6a) in order to create an [interactive ChatBot for the UCF SPARK form](https://share.chatling.ai/s/MiP7Xknuof8DUR6), which is a document that is required for incoming students who are still in high school to fill out prior to choosing their first courses. 

## Background 
This document is notoriously tedious for students as it requires filling out many lines and transcribing directly from transcripts, which in themselves can be confusing to navigate. I had a difficult time myself when I had to use it and found myself watching a UCF SPARK workshop, reading over their FAQ page numerous times, and seeking outside answers on a Reddit thread. It would’ve helped me so much if I was able to ask direct questions and receive immediate feedback. So, four years later, I created that solution with SPARKBot. 

## Strengths and Weaknesses of this AI Model
The AI in this bot accurately answers the questions that I have asked so far regarding questions surrounding the form as it is pulling its knowledge directly from the SPARK form page as well as the FAQ page only. Any other specific data regarding other university endeavors was not included, so this bot is specifically for questions surrounding this form only.

The only aspect that AI won’t do well is, obviously, provide the most accurate answers that a human professional would be able to if circumstances are incredibly unique and are difficult to navigate. But, this bot, and many others, are made for general or semi-specific questions that can be answered without having to utilize outside sources if necessary, so I think that this AI is 
particularly done well. 

## Re-Prompting 
With this AI model, the only prompt I had to modify was when I queried it to have a friendly tone with exclamation points in order to sound lighthearted and welcoming. Unfortunately, it added too many, along with emojis, and made it lose its professionalism as a university-aligned tool. So, I re-prompted it to “Read {user_question} and answer in a friendly, lighthearted, manner. Do not include emojis”. It adjusted well and gave me the personality and tone I was looking for. 

## The Future 
Artificial Intelligence has already progressed beyond anything I have ever imagined it could be, especially within the short time span that it has been incorporated into mainstream use. I believe that Chatbots have the potential to be useful, especially with tedious documents like these, if their errors become a lot lower than they already are. ChatGPT and other AI models have a high chance of getting answers wrong, which can lead to errors in various ways; if these are able to become more reliable as time goes on, Chatbots have a bright future. 
But, at the same time, I believe that humans will always want to communicate with other humans and AI may just become another inconvenience to consumers.
