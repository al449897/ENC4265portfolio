# Wayback Analysis
Amazon is a powerhouse website that sells hundreds of thousands of items from furniture to dental care. To accommodate for the amount of consumers they receive daily, their current website reflects a simplistic and easy user experience that allows for items to be searched or found within seconds. Unfortunately, their website has not always had the best design for its products. In this blog, I'll be briefly analyzing Amazon's home page from their 2000 website and comparing it to their current 2025 one. 
## The Problem

Immediately when navigating this April 2000 archived site, I was overwhelmed by the amount of text and hyperlinks. The inclusion of the left sidebar named “Browse” seems redundant considering the top menu that includes the same categories; it’s a waste of space and confusing for users. These horizontal sidebars are what threw me off the most, as there were so many options to choose from and very minimal design elements to aid in those choices.

 I also rarely see sidebars like these anymore either, as menus are usually horizontally laid out on the top of a webpage so users can read it more naturally from left to right as opposed from top to bottom. It was difficult to take in everything on the page, and it took me entirely too long to read through all of the options that I was presented with. I felt like I was reading pages worth of content as I am so used to seeing all of my options laid out in front of me within seconds, and then further diving into subcategories through that. If this was Amazon’s website in 2025, it would not be as popular of a platform as it is today.

## Modern Websites and Their Solutions  
Websites today tend to have less open white space, bigger text, more color, distinct headings, and a more “cleaned-up” look that has minimal distractions, huge text or photos, or misplaced links and headings. Amazon’s current home page layout is vastly different from their 2000 one, as they have a shortened menu at the top underneath the search bar so that users can quickly look up or navigate to the item they are looking for. The deals and promoted items are right underneath this to inform users of what they might be interested in, but it is set up in a way that fills up space and is easy to look at thanks to the photos and organization that is presented. This is an amazing home page in my opinion, as I can get to what I need within seconds and not be overwhelmed by unnecessary information when I decide to shop.

Overall, modern website design is heavily catered to have the easiest user experience in order for them to complete their purchase or task quickly. Amazon’s previous websites have been constantly revamped, as they lacked coherence, simplicity, and design, to become what it is today.
